== Demo

=== Repositories

* Order of repositories _is important_
* Avoid _mavenLocal()_ at all costs
** Not strictly a repository, but a cache for Maven
* Metadata and artifacts downloaded concurrently

=== How Gradle searches for binaries

* Gradle _knows_ where an artifact comes from
* Get the SHA1 of the artifact (GET or HEAD)
* Looks in its dependency cache if something at the same GAV has the same hash
* If so, uses it

Consequence: even if you get a file from _Maven Central_, then you change the repository to _JCenter_, if the artifacts are the same, downloaded only once.

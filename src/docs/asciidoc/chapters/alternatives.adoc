Alternative image build tools

=== Restricted environments

* Building a Docker image (obviously) requires a Docker daemon
* This means running with root privileges
* Ever run a `docker image build` through an CD pipeline that is piling up garbage images?
* Have very tight security on your Kubernetes cluster not allowing privileged containers?

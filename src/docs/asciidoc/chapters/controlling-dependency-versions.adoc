== Controlling dependency versions

=== Rich version constraints

=== Meaning of versions

* What does it mean to say: "I depend on 1.1"
* Does it mean it doesn't work using 1.0?
* Implicit statement: "I should work with 1.1+"
* What if it's not true?

=== Meaning of versions

* Use `latest.release`?
* Dependency on `1.2-beta-3`: is `beta` important?
* Dependency on snapshots...

=== Enter rich version constraints

[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
   implementation(project(":gitutils"))
   implementation("info.picocli:picocli") {
       version {
          strictly("[3.9, 4.0[")
          prefer("3.9.5")
       }
       because("Provides command-line argument parsing")
   }
}
----

=== Version constraints

* Legacy notation (without `version` block) translates to `require`
* `require`: doesn't accept any lower version, upgrades are acceptable
* `strictly`: if any other version in the graph disagrees, fails
* `prefer`: weak constraint, if nobody else cares, choose this version

=== How to choose?

=== How to choose?

* Look at https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/declaring_dependencies.html#sub:declaring_dependency_rich_version[Full reference]

=== Dynamic versions

* Snapshots
* Ranges (`[1.0, [`, `[1.1, 1.4]`, ...)
* Head selectors (`latest.release`, `latest.integration`)
* Cached to avoid too many repository lookups

=== Control over dynamic versions

[source,groovy]
----
    configurations.all {
        resolutionStrategy.cacheDynamicVersionsFor 0, 'seconds'
    }
----

* Warning: significant impact on performance!

=== Control over dynamic versions

* `--refresh-dependencies`: has impact **only on dynamic modules**
* Absolutely no relationship with Maven local repository or Gradle artifact cache

=== Dependency locking

* If you use dynamic versions (`[1.0, [`, `1.+`, `latest.release`, ...)
* Builds become _non reproducible_
* Solution: dependency locking

=== Dependency locking

* Lock a single configuration

[source,kotlin]
----
configurations {
   compileClasspath {
      resolutionStrategy.activateDependencyLocking()
   }
}
----

=== Dependency locking

* Convenience for locking _all_ configurations

[source,kotlin]
----
dependencyLocking {
    lockAllConfigurations()
}

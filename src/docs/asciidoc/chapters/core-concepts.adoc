== Core concepts

=== API vs implementation

* To _build_ a library, you need:
** API+implementation dependencies
* To _compile_ against a library, you need:
** API dependencies
* To _run_, you need:
** API+implementation+runtime only dependencies

=== Configurations

* 3 kinds of configurations
** "buckets" of dependencies
** resolvable configurations
** consumable configurations

=== Buckets of dependencies

* A list of dependencies
* `canBeConsumed=false`
* `canBeResolved=false`

=== Resolvable configurations

* Represents a _consumer_
* For a specific _usage_ (compiling, runtime, ...)
* Extends from one or more bucket
* `canBeConsumed=false`
* `canBeResolved=true`

=== Consumable configurations

* Represents a variant of a _producer_
* Attaches _artifacts_
* Extends from one or more bucket
* `canBeConsumed=true`
* `canBeResolved=false`

=== Repositories

* Out of the box support for Maven, Ivy and file repositories
* Order of repositories _is important_
* Avoid _mavenLocal()_ at all costs

== Core concepts

=== Definitions

[%step]
* *Module*
** A piece of software that evolves over time
** Has a group, name and version to identify it
** Example: `org.slf4j:slf4j-api:1.7.2`
* *Configuration* +
In the context of dependency management, and for most users:
** Named set of dependencies
** Provides access to resolved modules and their artifacts
** Example: `implementation`

=== API and implementation

=== More bucket configurations

image::configurations/bucket_2.png[width=100%, height=100%]

=== Bucket configurations relationship

image::configurations/bucket_3.png[width=100%, height=100%]

=== API vs implementation

* To _build_ a module, you need:
** `api`, `implementation` and `compileOnly` dependencies
* To _run_ a module, you need:
** `api`, `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` dependencies

=== Classpath configurations

image::configurations/classpath.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== API vs implementation transitively

* To _build against_ a module, you need:
** transitive `api` dependencies
* To _run against_ a module, you need:
** transitive `api`, `implementation` and `runtimeOnly` dependencies

=== Elements configurations

image::configurations/complete.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== Configurations

* 3 kinds of configurations
[%step]
** "buckets" of dependencies
** resolvable configurations
** consumable configurations

=== Buckets of dependencies

[%step]
* A named list of dependencies
* `canBeConsumed=false` +
  `canBeResolved=false`

=== Resolvable configurations

[%step]
* Represents a _consumer_
* For a specific _usage_ (compiling, runtime, ...)
* Extends from one or more bucket(s)
* `canBeConsumed=false` +
  `canBeResolved=true`

=== Consumable configurations

[%step]
* Represents a variant of a _producer_
* Attaches _artifacts_
* Extends from one or more bucket
* `canBeConsumed=true` +
  `canBeResolved=false`

=== Matching consumers with producers

[%step]
* Gradle needs a way to perform the matching between consumers and producers
* Attributes and attribute matching are the answer
* Variants are the unit, identified by their attributes

=== Compilation against project(1)

=== Compilation against project(2)

=== Compilation against project(3)

image::consumer/compile3.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== Compilation against project API (1)

=== Compilation against project API (2)

=== Compilation against project API (3)

image::consumer/compileapi3.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== Runtime against project (1)

image::consumer/runtime1.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== Runtime against project (2)

image::consumer/runtime2.png[width=100%, heighth=100%]

=== Runtime against project (3)

=== Against external dependency

=== Semantics and dependencies

Gradle has a strong model of dependencies:

* Semantic difference between compilation and runtime
* Semantic difference between building a library and building _against_ a library
* Ability for a module to produce more than one variant
** More on this in the followup webinars

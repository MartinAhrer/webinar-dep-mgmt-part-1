== Images and layers

=== Anatomy of a Docker image

[.notes]
--
* A Docker image is built up from a series of layers.
* Each layer represents an instruction in the image’s Dockerfile
* A storage driver handles the details about the way these layers interact with each other
* Different storage drivers are available, which have advantages and disadvantages in different situations.
** e.g. AUFS, overlay, overlay2, btrfs,zfs
* All drivers use stackable image layers and the copy-on-write (CoW) strategy for writing files

== Container and layers

=== Copy-On Write (CoW)

[.notes]
--
* When you start a container, a thin writable container layer is added on top of the other layers.
* Any changes the container makes to the filesystem are stored here
** Search through the image layers for the file to update
** Perform a copy_up operation on the first copy of the file that is found, to copy the file to the container’s writable layer.
* Write heavy applications should use volumes to store data for more efficient I/O
* COW performance is heavily dependent on the storage driver

=== Storage layer

[.notes]
--
* Creating a new container from an image just adds a new layer for container storage
* Not only does copy-on-write save space, but it also reduces start-up time.
* When you start a container (or multiple containers from the same image), Docker only needs to create the thin writable container layer.
* Likewise when deleting a container, only the writable layer has to be deleted
--

=== Volumes

[.notes]
--
* Data volumes are not controlled by the storage driver.
* Reads and writes to data volumes bypass the storage driver and operate at native host speeds.
* You can mount any number of data volumes into a container.
* Multiple containers can also share one or more data volumes.
* When a container is deleted, any data stored in data volumes persists on the Docker host.

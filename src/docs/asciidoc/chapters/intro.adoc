== Why dependency management?

=== Source vs published

* Sources
** (mostly) reliable
** (often) slow
** never touched
** hard to version
** safe

=== Source vs published (2)

* Binaries
** Stable
** Fast (pre-built)
** Requires trusted sources
** Not always metadata

=== Consuming binaries

* A `lib` directory
* From a Maven repository
** Maven Central (OSS libraries)
** Private repositories (closed source, proxies)
* From an Ivy repository
** Artifactory, ...
* From a custom repository
** JitPack, ...

=== Lib directory

* Straightforward
* No dependency management at all
* Binaries in SCM

=== Maven/Ivy repository

* GAV coordinates
* transitive dependencies management
* metadata format restricts what you can do

=== Custom repositories

* Not portable
* Hard to consume transitively

=== Maven != Maven Central

* Maven: a build tool
* Maven **repository**: a place where you can find binaries

=== Source dependencies
